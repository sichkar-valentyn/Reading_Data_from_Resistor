## Description
The sketch reads data from analog input and compare the results in the loop.
If the value is bigger than certain number it sends the signal to one digital output and switch on the red LED.
If the value is lower than certain number it sends the signal to another digital output and switch on the green LED.

In both cases sketch switch off the second LED while switching on the first one.
